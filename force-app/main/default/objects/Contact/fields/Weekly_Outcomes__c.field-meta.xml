    <fullName>Weekly_Outcomes__c</fullName>
    <description>Field is populated by the &quot;AlumniUtilities&quot; Apex Class.

It was created to make it easier to report on alumni positive outcomes numbers at set intervals after graduation. e.g., what % of alumni were a positive outcome 2 weeks after graduation? What about 10 weeks after? The syntax is: 

Weeknum:PosOutcome:Employed:FT School; 

where Weeknum is the # of weeks after graduation, and the next 3 fields are each a 1 or a 0 based on whether the grad was a positive outcome, was employed, or was in FT school or training that week.</description>
